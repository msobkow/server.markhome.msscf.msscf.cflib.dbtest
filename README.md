MSS Code Factory 3.0 CFLib Transactional JPA test framework application to demonstrate JPA configuration and basic structure

This test application was used primarily to figure out all the plumbing and glue required to set up a functional JPA environment with transactional annotations, custom pkey data types, nested transactions across multiple repositories, and generally provide a starting point framework for future JPA development.

Without a good foundation, you can't build a house, and it turns out that there is a dearth of complete and up-to-date examples that focus specifically on Spring JPA setup.  I also suspect there were some bugs in Spring that were fixed over the past two dot-releases since I started my efforts.
